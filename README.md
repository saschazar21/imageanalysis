You will be able to open any kind of <b>jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tif</b>,
if the size is too big, it will be resized to a given max. size.

The application then will filter your pixel values and rearrange them,
from the most common to the least common RGB-values.

After computation succeeded you will be presented with an image filled with colored dots 
on each position containing the same color value as the pixel over which your mouse is 
currently hovering.<br>
Press <b>'w'</b> to show/hide a circle containing the same color as well as having a
