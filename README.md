You will be able to open any kind of <b>jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tif</b>,
if the size is too big, it will be resized to a given max. size.

The application then will filter your pixel values and rearrange them,
from the most common to the least common RGB-values.

<p>
Open any desired image and let the algorithm do its work.<br>
It will rearrange the extracted color values to the first possible color value found
after a randomly calculated starting point within the pixel array, which is also inside
a given tolerance area.<br>
To skip the process and show a calculated color wheel, press <b>'w'</b>.
